# NETS 212 TA Feedback Form
## What?
Small node application for students of NETS 212 (Cloud Computing) class to provide feedbacks to the Teaching Assistants of the class.
The feedback is completely anonymous and encrypted, such that only the designated TA is able to see it (Not even the database admin / server owner can see it.)

## Why?
Would have had to create *multiple* Google Forms to achieve the same effect, and it could potentially have spammed emails.
Instead, this groups everything in one place. And, most importantly: It uses 100% only concepts taught in the class, to showcase their practicality, even though the app itself is very small.


## How? 
Uses Node, express, DynamoDB, EC2 (Well, any server really), jQuery, Bootstrap.
Code should look similar to the homeworks of the course.
It is quick & dirty code so don't take anything away in terms of design, but feel free to browse around - it's basically all in one file.
